# Color Picker

AngularJs Color Picker with touch support.

Installation:

1.  Add style.css and color-picker-component.js to your application.
2.  Inject 'colorPicker' into your application.
3.  Add <color-picker color="{{yourColorDataBinding}}"></color-picker> to your template.

#### @TODO
Currently, the color picker always initializes with white and centers. Need to use passed in color data binding for initial value and position.
